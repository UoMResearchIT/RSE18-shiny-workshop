# What I want to cover:

Using Shiny to make an interactive data-driven web app

## Formative assessments:

Adding a widget to an app

Adding an output to an app

"Wiring" the widget and output together

Deploying a Shiny app to shinyapps.io

Understanding and controlling how events are linked to each other.

# Concepts

## What is Shiny + what can we do with it?

## How we interact with Shiny - Widgets

## Reactivity (How Shiny responds to events) - inputs change ==> outputs change

## Deploying Shiny apps
