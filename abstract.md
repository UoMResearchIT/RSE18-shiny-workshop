## Workshop title

Data vizualisation with Shiny

## Abstract (250 words max) (187 words)

R has excellent and extensive data vizualisation facilities.  Shiny lets us make these interactive, by  creating web-based vizualisations within R.  These can be deployed using Shiny Server, or used locally within R.  Shiny is useful for exploratory work, prototyping, and production use.

In this workshop we will show users how to create an interactive vizualisations of tabular data. Inspired by Hans Rosling's excellent data vizualisations we will use the well-known gapminder data to motivate our the examples in our workshop.   We will cover making graphs with ggplot2, using Shiny widgets to allow the user to customise the graph, and making interactive graphs.  By the end of the workshop participants will be able to create simple, but extensible, Shiny apps.

## Skills/knowledge

A working knowledge of R (especially ggplot2) would be very useful for attendees.

## How will attendees benefit? (250 words max) (98 words)
  
This workshop will give participants the skills to create Shiny apps, which have been found to be useful tools in several contexts.  They can be used to present data and results to a PI, while also allowing them to explore the data. This often prompts further questions, suggested analyses and vizualisations from the PI, facilitating an iterative and flexible approach that is a key part of many research software engineering projects.  R's excellent graphing, mapping and data vizualisation facilities can be just a few dozen lines of code away from being a web app when we use Shiny.
