### Chapter 6

This section contains further exercises and examples of using Shiny.

The [Reactive data]({{<ref "reactive" >}}) lesson looks at a better way of handling the data we plot on the graph, so we can use it more than once.  Reactivity is an important concept in Shiny.    The [interacting with graphs]({{< ref "graphs" >}}) lesson looks at how we can use reactivity and events to get more information about a country when we click its point on the graph.  You should complete the [reactive data]({{<ref "reactive" >}}) lesson before this lesson.

The [layout]({{<ref "layout" >}}) lesson looks at changing the layout of the user interface.  It doesn't have any dependencies besides the first part of the workshop.
