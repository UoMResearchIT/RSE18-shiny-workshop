This site is for the [RSE 2018 conference workshop](https://rse.ac.uk/conf2018/) on Shiny. It is written by David Mawdsley, with help from Joshua Woodcok and Louise Lever, who are all [Research Software Engineers](https://rse.ac.uk/conf2018/) at the [University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk).  Thanks to [Christopher Woods](http://chryswoods.com/) at the [University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk) for his mentoring and comments.

This site is written using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), the [learn theme](https://github.com/matcornic/hugo-theme-learn/), and hosted on [github](https://github.com/UoMResearchIT/RSE18-shiny-workshop). The course materials (i.e. the R code, data and example solutions) are hosted in a [separate repository](https://github.com/UoMResearchIT/RSE18-shiny-workshop-materials/).
